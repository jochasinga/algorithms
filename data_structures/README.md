# Data Structures


### Collections

No inherent order just a collection of items
- Lists

- Arrays
(each array has a number that is called index which is used for finding the elements).
    Run time complexity. 
    1. insertion in array - O(n)
    2. deletion in array - O(n)
    3. finding element in an array - O(n)
        - with index : O(1)
    
    Python lists specifically - see the [official time complexity](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity)  
   
    
- Linked List
- Stacks 
- Queues

Arrays vs Linkedlist
- Adding or removing elements in linkedlist is very easy as compared to array

Map (Hashmap/Dictionary) is a set based data structure in which inherent ordering of elements is not there.
While list is a array like data structure.

### Trees aren't linear data structure for traversing unlike lists

Levels start with 0 being the root
#### BFS is a Level order traversal
